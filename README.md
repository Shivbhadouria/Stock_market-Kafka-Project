# Stock Market Kafka Data Engineering Project

#NOTE: This is not Real-time Data but you can you Real-Time data by getting API.

## Introduction 
This project focuses on leveraging real-time stock market data for analysis using a combination of Kafka, AWS services, and Python. 

## Architecture

## Technology Used
you'll develop expertise in the following areas:

Real-Time Data Simulation: Building a real-time data simulation application using Python to mimic stock market data flow.

Kafka Fundamentals: Gaining a deep understanding of Kafka's core components including Broker, Producer, Consumer, and Zookeeper.

Kafka Setup on AWS: Installing and configuring Kafka on Amazon EC2 instances or other virtual machines within the AWS environment.

Python Programming: Writing producer and consumer code in Python to interact with the Kafka stream.

Data Streaming Pipeline: Developing a real-time streaming pipeline to collect stock market data and store it in AWS S3.

Real-Time Data Analysis: Analyzing the incoming data stream in real-time to gain insights into stock market trends and patterns.

AWS Services Integration: Leveraging AWS services such as S3 for data storage and Athena for querying and analysis.

Data Warehousing: Storing real-time stock market data in AWS S3 for further processing and analysis.

Real-Time Insights: Extracting real-time insights from the data stream using Amazon Athena.

Application Development: Combining the components to build a comprehensive real-time stock market data analysis application.

## Dataset Used
You can you any data I have used Free data CSV files because I don't have money to pay Paid API for stock Data ðŸ˜‚
